  tagline: Lifecycle-aware ViewModels, explicit dependencies, automatic cleanup. Patterns that have worked for years — now in Flutter.

features:
  - title: Explicit Dependencies
    details: Constructor injection, not magic. You can trace the dependency graph by reading the code.
  - title: Automatic Lifecycle
    details: No more "if (mounted)" checks. Subscriptions cancel, tasks stop, state disposes — all automatically.
  - title: Plain Dart
    details: ViewModels are just Dart classes. Test without Flutter, mock without framework internals.
  - title: Incremental Adoption
    details: Works alongside your existing state solution. Migrate one feature at a time.
